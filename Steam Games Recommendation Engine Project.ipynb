    "I started the project by trying to fix the CSV file downloaded from the kaggle database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset), but there was an issue in the file that caused columns to be mislabeled. I tried fixing it, but it was taking too much time so I decided to the json file on the site, which after converting to a dataframe and transposing it, I managed to export it as a csv file which is what you see below. I created a new notebook to start with the new csv file."
